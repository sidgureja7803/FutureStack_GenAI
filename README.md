## 🧠 Multi-Agent AI Architecture

IdeaHub’s intelligence layer is powered by **five specialized AI agents**, each designed for a specific domain of business analysis.  
These agents collaborate sequentially using **LangChain** and **LangGraph**, creating an autonomous analysis pipeline.

| Agent | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| 🏢 **Market Analyst** | Identifies market size, growth trends, and target audiences |
| 💡 **TAM/SAM Estimator** | Calculates Total & Serviceable Market sizes |
| ⚔️ **Competitor Scanner** | Maps competitors, emerging players, and market gaps |
| 🔬 **Feasibility Evaluator** | Assesses technical, operational, and financial viability |
| 🧭 **Strategy Recommender** | Generates go-to-market and differentiation strategies |

Each agent’s output is structured and composable, forming a detailed, investor-ready report.

## 🤖 AI Model Integration

### ⚡ **Cerebras Integration**

IdeaHub leverages the **Cerebras Inference API** for ultra-fast, high-performance LLM inference.

- Powers market research and strategic recommendation agents  
- Delivers structured JSON responses in **~1.5–2s** average latency  
- Executes **multi-agent reasoning** in parallel with minimal overhead  
- Enables **scalable concurrent processing** across pipelines  

```javascript
async function runAgent(agentName, prompt) {
  return await cerebrasClient.generateText(prompt, {
    temperature: 0.3,
    maxTokens: 2048
  });
}
🔹 Impact: Reduced total analysis time by ~4× and enabled real-time multi-agent execution.

🦙 Llama Models
IdeaHub integrates Llama 3 models for deep contextual reasoning and domain-specific analysis:

Context-aware market trend evaluation

Competitor differentiation and mapping

Financial forecasting and feasibility scoring

Strategic recommendation synthesis

🔹 Impact: Enabled human-like reasoning, coherent insight generation, and consistent tone across all agent outputs.
